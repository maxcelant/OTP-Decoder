If you are running your own test file(s) on the program, make sure to put them in the same directory as the main.py file, so it can find them.

Then simply use the `python3 main.py {file_name}` command to run the program and see the output in your terminal.

**NOTE** - I already have a file in the directory called `ciphertext.txt`, you can insert the ciphertext into this file or simply create your own - Then the command would be `python main.py ciphertext.txt`
